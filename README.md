DropChain is a revolutionary file sharing app that leverages the power of Blockchain technology to provide a secure and decentralized platform for users to share their files. The app uses Pinata to create a unique hash for each file, ensuring that it remains unalterable and tamper-proof. With DropChain, users can easily share their files with others without worrying about issues such as data breaches or hacking attempts. By utilizing the blockchain, DropChain ensures that all files are stored in a secure and decentralized network that is accessible to anyone, anytime, anywhere. This app is a game-changer in the world of file sharing, providing a new level of security and transparency that has never been seen before.

## What is Block Chain?

Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data.

## How to run the project?

1. First choose an image by using the "Choose File" button. Then click on the "Upload File" button to upload the image to the blockchain.
2. "Get Data" button is used to retrieve the image from the IPFS network and can further verify all the files that have been uploaded.
3. "Share" button is used to share the access with the other users. You can type in a new address or select a pre-existing address from the dropdown list to share the access with the users.
4. You can select the address of the user you want to share the access with from the dropdown list and click on the "Share" button to share the access with the user.
5. You can click on "People with Access" to know who all have access to your data.
